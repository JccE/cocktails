# BRANDY

Brandy, from the Dutch term “brandewijn” (burned wine), refers to the process of distillation in which wine is heated in a pot still to produce vaporous alcohol. Brandy encompasses a number of categories including grappa, eau de vie, and marc, but generally refers to a distillate made from fermented fruit, sometimes aged in oak casks, that is traditionally bottled at 40 percent alcohol by volume.

## Types & Derivatives

**Cognac**  
Cognac is named after a town in the Department of Charente, which lies north of Bordeaux and inland from the Atlantic coast of France. Here many of the finest brandies in the world are distilled from wines made with Ugni Blanc, Folle Blanche, and Colombard grapes, grown in chalky, loam and clay soils. Cognac is double-distilled in a unique pot still called the Charentais alembic. Cognac, by law, is matured in Limousin or Tronçais oak barrels for at least two years. Very Special (V.S.) Cognac is aged for at least two years; Very Superior Old Pale (V.S.O.P.) Cognac is aged for at least four years; and Extra Old (X.O.) Cognac is aged for at least six years. Virtually all Cognac is a blend of brandies of different ages from one or “more of the six demarcated growing regions: Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne, Borderies, Fin Bois, Bon Bois, and Bois a Terroir. -- *Hine V.S.O.P.* • *Martell V.S.O.P.* • *Pierre Ferrand Ambre* • *Rémy Martin V.S.O.P”*

**Peruvian Pisco**  
Peruvian Pisco is distilled from the musts of freshly fermented grapes harvested in a subtropical desert environment between the foothills of the Andes and the Pacific coast in Peru. Eight grape varieties are permitted including Quebranta, Molar, Italia, Moscatel, and Torontel. Peruvian pisco is pot-distilled after a long, natural fermentation, then rested for a minimum of three months in neutral vessels: nothing may be added to alter the flavor or appearance. Peruvian pisco is classified in four categories: puro, from one grape; aromatic or non-aromatic, depending on the grapes used; Mosto Verde, if the grapes are partially fermented; and Acholado, if a mix of aromatic and non-aromatic grapes is used. All Peruvian pisco is bottled at the proof it comes off the still. No reduction of alcohol level is permitted in any form. -- *Barsol Quebranta* • *La Diablada* • *Macchu Pisco*

**Applejack**  
Applejack, produced from bittersweet cider apples from trees planted by the Pilgrims, was one of the first spirits produced in America. Laird & Company, founded in 1780 in Scobeyville, New Jersey, is the oldest commercial distillery in the country. Laird's produces applejack, a blend of apple brandy and neutral spirit, and a range of apple brandies including a bonded (100-proof) apple brandy that requires 20 pounds of apples to produce each bottle. -- *Laird’s* • *Laird’s Bonded Apple Brandy*

**Eau de Vie**  
Eau de Vie, French for “Water of Life,” refers to the unaged alembic brandies produced from fresh fruit. The most famous come from the Alps region of Europe. Types include kirschwasser (cherries), framboise (raspberries), mirabelle (plums), and Poire Williams (pears). -- *Clear Creek Kirschwasser* • *Clear Creek Pear Brandy* • *Clear Creek Plum Brandy* • *Nonino Gioiello* • *Trimbach Framboise*

**Brandy de Jerez**  
Brandy de Jerez is distilled from wine produced from Airen and Palomino grapes grown in La Mancha, in central Spain. Brandy de Jerez is distilled once using either a traditional copper pot or column still, then aged in 500-liter American oak casks that previously contained sherry. The final product is blended using a complex system known as “Solera,” in which brandies of different ages are blended and labeled as Solera, Solera Reserva, or Solera Gran Reserva grade brandy. Solera Gran Reserva brandy is entirely potdistilled and aged eight years on average. -- *Gran Duque D’Alba*
